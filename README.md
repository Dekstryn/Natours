# Project Błędne skały
![Szczyty górskie za chmurami](https://github.com/Dekstryn/Natours/blob/master/img/BledneSkaly_FB.png)
During the **Advaced CSS training**, I created a website template that I liked. I decided to use it to create my own website. Choosing the topic of the page was very simple. We were recently in Błędne Skały. We liked it very much and decided to put some information about this area on the site. Plus the personal opinions of each family member and the site is ready.
## Technology used
On this page I used only **HTML** and **CSS**
In CSS I used **animation** and **transition** to get additional look effects.
Also, I used CSS background properties to get a nice filter and video background.
